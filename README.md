# Json-Merge

A program that can merge a series of files containing a JSON array of objects into a single file containing one JSON object

# Instructions:

Run the JsonMerge.java file

1. Give the following parameters as an input â€“
a. Folder Path: The folder where all the JSON files are stored.
b. Input File Base Name: The common prefix all file names share. In our 
example above, this prefix was data.
c. Output File Base Name: The prefix for the merged file name 
generated by the merge utility.
d. Max File Size: The maximum file size (in bytes) that each merged file 
is allowed to be.
e.Destination Path


# Basic Functionalities:

1. The utility will read all files in the Folder Path that begin with the Input File 
Base Name, and process them in increasing order of the number added as a 
suffix to each file (1,2,3,....,12,13,...).
2. The utility will ensure that the output files are named using the Output File 
Base Name as a prefix, and a counter as a suffix.
3. Merged files will never be greater than Max File Size.
4. Each output file will contain a proper JSON array.


# Additional Cases handled 
1. Nested array of objects
 		eg:
 			employee:[{name:emp1,phoneNos:[9988199,9988102]}]
 
 2.Multiple keys
 		eg:
 		 striker:[{name:'a',age:1}],
 			employee:[{name:'emp1'}]
  where striker and employees are split into different files
